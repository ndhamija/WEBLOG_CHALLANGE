STEP 1 : 

   REPLACE THE SPACES WITH PIPE (|) IGNORING THE ONES IN DOUBLES QUOTES (SO THAT IT CAN BE INGESTED IN HIVE)

   %s/ /|/g

   Also prevent the ones in the Double Quotes getting Replacd (
   
   perl -pe 's{("[^"]+")}{($x=$1)=~tr/|/ /;$x}ge' nareshnew)

   
STEP 2: 

	CREATE A TABLE ON HIVE 

	CREATE TABLE APPLICATION_DATA
	(
	DATEFIELD STRING,
	SHOP_TYPE STRING,
	IP_ADDRESS1 STRING,
	IP_ADDRESS2 STRING,
